    "One view on interaction is to see user intentions as **unknown values** which are partially observed through input sensors. The time series of inputs from the user only give a partial, noisy, incomplete view of intention inside the user's head. \n",
    "\n",
    "Probabilistic filtering **(PF)** tracks the evolution of some unknown variables *[user intentions]* given observed evidence *[user input]*, in a way that is **robust**. Probabilistic filters infer a **distribution** over possible hidden (unobserved) variables, updating them over time. These filters are inherently **uncertain**, as they represent degrees of belief, and **dynamic**, as they explicitly model changing state over time.\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"imgs/brain_inference.png\">\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Simulation viewpoint\n",
    "These filters are really *simulators*. They *simulate* how possible user behaviors might unfold over time. In some probabilistic filters, hundreds of parallel simulators are run, each with slightly different parameters. In all cases, the simulations are adjusted online to better match observed reality. The internal parameters that drive the simulation are the *unknown variables* we want to infer and the *evidence* is the observed reality that adjusts the simulation parameters.\n",

    "### Problem\n",
    "We want to recognize 2D gestures drawn with a mouse (or finger/stylus). \n",
    "* We *observe* sequences of $x,y$ coordinates over time.\n",
    "* We have some example templates for particular shapes that we want to match (e.g. letters)\n",
    "* We don't know:\n",
    "    * where the user will start drawing a gesture\n",
    "    * how big the gesture will be    \n",
    "    * how fast the user will draw the gesture (it may well be drawn at a non-constant speed)\n",
    "* We want to be able to identify:  \n",
    "    * which gesture the user is performing, if any\n",
    "    * when the user has finished doing the gesture\n",
    "    \n",
    "#### Probabilistic view\n",
    "Putting this into the probabilistic framework, we want to infer a probability distribution over gesture classes and gesture completion state, given a time series of $x,y$ coordinates. The $x,y$ points form our observation vector $Y$.\n",
    "\n",
    "We assume gesture reproduction is in some way a \"noisy reproduction\" of the ideal template form, where there are various types of distortion that can be encountered.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Markov approximation\n",
    "We could look at the whole time series of $x,y$ points and try and classify that. However, there are two problems:\n",
    "* What is the \"whole\" time series -- i.e. how do we segment the gesture?\n",
    "* We would have to store the entire series and somehow match it against templates.\n",
    "\n",
    "A simple way to eliminate these problems is to rewrite the recognizer so that it depends on nothing but its immediately previous state; i.e. so that it satisfies the Markov property.\n",
    "\n",
    "To do this, we need to introduce additional variables into the state we are estimating; but with judicious choice these can be a very small number of additional variables. In particular, we can just track how far along a gesture we are (the \"phase\") and update that over time. "

    "### Parameters\n",
    "We are now in a position to write down a model for our gesture recognizer.\n",
    "\n",
    "### State\n",
    "First of all, the state we are trying to infer:\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"imgs/gesture.png\">\n",
    "\n",
    "$$X = [i,s,x_c,y_c,\\theta,\\phi,\\dot{\\phi}]$$\n",
    "\n",
    "We have one of $n$ possible gestures\n",
    "* $i$ the number of the gesture\n",
    "\n",
    "Our model says a gesture will be identical to the template for that class of gesture, but might vary in:\n",
    "* $s$ overall scale, within some tolerance\n",
    "* $x_c,y_c$ center position (could be anywhere on screen)\n",
    "* $\\theta$ small changes in rotation (e.g. $<45^o$)\n",
    "\n",
    "We must take note that what we observe is a position at a **single time point** in a gesture. This means we must estimate how far through a gesture we are.\n",
    "* $\\phi$ the proportion of gesture complete, in the fraction [0,1].\n",
    "* $\\dot{\\phi}$ the rate at which the gesture is being performed (i.e. fast or slow).\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Observation\n",
    "\n",
    "* Given a gesture $i$, we have a template $G_i(\\phi)$, which is returns an $x,y$ point for any value of $\\phi$.\n",
    "\n",
    "* We expect to observe $\\hat{{\\bf y}}=AG_i(\\phi)$, where $A$ is a transformation matrix applying the translation $x_c,y_c$, the scaling $s$ and the rotation $\\theta$.\n",

    "### Scope and limitations\n",
    "#### Scope\n",
    "* Probabilistic filters can be applied to many problems in HCI. Typically, if a process unfolds over time and there is uncertainty, a probabilistic filter is a strong candidate for inference. \n",
    "\n",
    "* The fact that inference is performed over time is a potential advantage over \"static\" classification approaches, as feedback can be generated on the fly, instead only after completion of an action. \n",
    "\n",
    "* In the specific context of gestures, the ability to infer the end-point of gestures can solve the \"segmentation problem\" that is often awkward and leads to kludges like button presses to segment actions.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Probabilistic motion models can easily be linked to higher-order probabilistic models which infer long-term actions on the part of the user. Because everything is a probability distribution, there is a simple common basis for integrating such models. This, for example, can include language models which estimate a distribution over text that is likely to be entered given both user input and a statistical model of language.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Limitations\n",
    "* PFs can be computationally intensive to run. \n",
    "* Curse-of-dimensionality can make the attractive simplicity of PFs work poorly in practice as the state space expands (although often better than you might expect).\n",
    "* Sometimes the inverse probability model can be hard to formulate. Conversely, it is sometimes very much easier.\n",
    "* Particle filters are simple and elegant, but inferentially weak.\n",
    "* Kalman filters are rigid and restrictive, but very inferentially efficient.\n",
    "* Hybrid approaches (Ensemble Kalman filter, Unscented Kalman Filter, hybrid particle/Kalman filters, Rao-Blackwellized filters) can trade these qualities off, but they aren't off the shelf solutions (i.e. you need an expert!).\n",

    "### Future of probabilistic filtering\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Learned models\n",
    "\n",
    "Much use of probabilistic filters has depended on strong mathematical models of the fundamental process. For example, in rocket science, sophisticated physics models were used to specify the Kalman filters used for stable control. \n",
    "\n",
    "However, it is becoming increasingly possible to **infer** these models from observations. Techniques such as deep learning (for example variational autoencoders or generative adversarial networks) make it possible to learn very sophisticated *generative models* from observations of\n",
    "data.  These models can be dropped into probabilistic filters to produce robust inferential engines for user interaction.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Example\n",
    "As an illustrative example, we recently built a touch pose estimator to estimate the pose of a finger from a capacitive sensor array (as found on a touch screen). We trained DCNN to predict finger pose from sensor images (inverse model), a separate deconvolutional CNN to predict sensor images from finger poses (forward model) and then fused these using a particle filter.\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"imgs/fwd_inv.png\">\n",
    "This combined gives substantial robustness, and we were able to introduce a simple dynamics model, which filters out completely implausible movements.\n",
