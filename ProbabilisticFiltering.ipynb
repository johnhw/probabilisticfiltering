    "### What is probabilistic filtering?\n",
    "One view on interaction is to see user intentions as **unknown values** which are partially observed through input sensors. The time series of inputs only give a partial, noisy, incomplete view of intention. \n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"imgs/brainspace.png\" width=\"100%\">\n",
    "\n",
    "Probabilistic filtering makes it possible to track the evolution of some unknown variables [user intentions] given observed evidence [input], in a way that is **robust**. They work by inferring a **distribution** over possible hidden variables, and updating them over time.\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"imgs/stochastic.png\" width=\"50%\">\n",
    "\n",
    "Probabilistic filtering is an **inverse probability** approach, and it requires that we think of interaction from a unique perspective. We have to explicitly be able to write down:\n",
    "\n",
    "* what we want to know (i.e. the **state space of intention**);\n",
    "* how that will change over time (i.e. the **dynamics of intention**);\n",
    "*  a model that *if we knew what the user intention was, what the expected behavior would be* (i.e. a **function mapping intention -> expected inputs**).\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that this last point is the **inverse** of the typical way of approaching this problem, where we try and find a mapping from a sensors to intention, by design or by learning. \n"

    "### Why is this computational HCI?\n",
    "Probabilistic filtering means writing down an **executable, statistical model** of user behavior, then **running an inference algorithm** that updates beliefs based on the way observations evolve. \n",
    "\n",
    "This has the two key elements of computational interaction:\n",
    "* an explicit mathematical model of user-system behavior;\n",
    "* an algorithmic element that, using this model, can apply computational power to improving interaction.\n",
    "\n",

    "* more powerful algorithms;  \n",
    "* or increased computational power, \n",

    "rather than the workhorses of traditional HCI:\n",
    "* more design ingenuity;\n",
    "* and stronger evaluation."

    "* **Crafted mappings**, where we try to find (by hand) transforms from sensors to intentions that are  simple or obvious. **Example:** a button, which has two physical states, and maps on to two intentional states via two electrical states. Pushed down = current flows = user intended to switch on. The mapping from electrical states to intentional states is **designed.**\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Machine learned mappings**, where we train a system to recognize a class of input patterns as being representative of an intended behavior. **Example:** Finger gesture recognizer; hundreds of examples of many users performing one of N multi-touch gestures are recorded. These are used to train a random forest to classify the intended gesture. The mapping from electrical states (capacitive sensors) to intentional states is **learned**."

    "* **Robustness to intermittence** PFs can continue to sensibly interpolate when input cuts out.\n",

    "* **Easy fusion of multiple input sensors** PFs are often used to solely to fuse together multiple inputs from different sensors.\n",
    "* **Better feedback** PFs predict distributions over past, present and future, and they offer the opportunity to give rich feedback insights to users.\n",
    "* **Flexible modeling** PFs can incorporate both fundamental modeling (e.g. physiological or cognitive models) and data-driven machine learning."
