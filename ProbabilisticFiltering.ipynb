    "One view on interaction is to see user intentions as **unknown values** which are partially observed through input sensors. The time series of inputs from the user only give a partial, noisy, incomplete view of intention inside the user's head. \n",
    "\n",
    "Probabilistic filtering **(PF)** tracks the evolution of some unknown variables *[user intentions]* given observed evidence *[user input]*, in a way that is **robust**. Probabilistic filters infer a **distribution** over possible hidden (unobserved) variables, updating them over time. These filters are inherently **uncertain**, as they represent degrees of belief, and **dynamic**, as they explicitly model changing state over time.\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"imgs/brain_inference.png\">\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Simulation viewpoint\n",
    "These filters are really *simulators*. They *simulate* how possible user behaviors might unfold over time. In some probabilistic filters, hundreds of parallel simulators are run, each with slightly different parameters. In all cases, the simulations are adjusted online to better match observed reality. The internal parameters that drive the simulation are the *unknown variables* we want to infer and the *evidence* is the observed reality that adjusts the simulation parameters.\n",

    "Much use of probabilistic filters has depended on strong mathematical models of the fundamental process. For example, in rocket science, sophisticated physics models were used to specify the Kalman filters used for stable control. \n",
